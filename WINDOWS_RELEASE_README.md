### Windows Installation Note

**Notice a warning when running the installer?** 

Windows Defender SmartScreen throws a "Windows protected your PC" blue warning screen for indie games and software that haven't been downloaded thousands of times to build up Microsoft's "reputation score." Because `TypingToucan Setup-1.0.msi` is a new file, it requires a manual permission to run.

**To successfully install the game:**
1. Click **"More info"** on the blue warning screen.
2. Click the **"Run anyway"** button that appears.

The installer will then safely extract the game and create your shortcuts!
