# Typing Toucan
A jungle themed typing game with a flying mechanic, built using LibGDX and coded with Kotlin.

## How to Run

To run the game, open a terminal in the project root and execute:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat run
```

## Features
- Learning mode is progressive, learn to type by unlocking letters one at a time across the keyboard.
- Already have some proficiency? No problem -- jump forward to the desired level.
- Practice mode allows you to select letters to practice, no penalty for running into obstacles but streak ends on mistype or hitting ground (typing too slowly).
- Text mode allows the user to type jungle facts.
- Typing system: Type letters to flap! The queue is in the middle of the screen. Make an error and the algorithm presents that letter more frequently.
- Difficulty levels Easy to Insane.
